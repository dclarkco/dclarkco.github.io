When the popular trading platform known as Robinhood ironically could not live up to its name, distributed traders on r/wallstreetbets took the market into their own wallets. 
Upon hearing that Melvin capital was planning a large short of the Gamestop stonk, these brave bulls brigaded the stonk, balloning its value to 400$, ensuring that the short squeeze would squoze.
Such a large movement by so many members has been broadly labelled as stonk manipulation, and the big bears responsible for the short cried fowl. As much as they tried to extend their shorts, the inevitable squeeze had squozed.
This remarkable phenomenon has been <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gamestop-reddit-wallstreetbets-short-squeeze-2021-01-28/">described as dangerous</a>, not only to the wallstreetbets gang, but to wall street as a whole. In short, it raises some ethical questions, as well as some interesting research opportunities.
</p>

<p>
First of all, ethical considerations must be made. Should large scale stonk manipulation be allowed? To me, this question is meaningless without context. Melvin and others had initially taken short positions
worth >130% of the market cap. Their ultimate goal was to run gamestonk to the ground and make some coin in the process. The market reacted and pumped those numbers up. If anything, it would seem that Melvin was
the manipulee and got <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-closes-out-gamestop-short-cnbc-2021-01-27">caught with their hands in the stonk jar.</a> So, is a free market making corrections to the demand of a stonk considered malicious manipulation, or might these traders simply like the stonk?
Why does wall street get a pass whenever they blatantly manipulate? Perhaps, more than anything, this event has realized some double standards in the market that are to be addressed if NYSE is to be an ethical and equal trading ground.
</p>

<p>
Research wise, this is an unprecedented coalition against wall street that surely holds some fascinating findings. Key questions include: 

	<ul type = "circle">
		<li>"Why GME?"</li>
		<li>"What events on the subreddit and elsewhere catalyzed this outcome?"</li>
		<li>"What behind the scenes cooperation occured in corporate America to perpetuate such a large short?"</li>
	</ul>
From a data science perspective, analyzing tweets and reddit posts will net a tremendous amount of insight, and correlating social
activity with trader activity could net some insights. Likewise, many of Melvin's attempted squeezes are visible in the data. How does the subreddit react to these sudden drops? Looking further back, has wallstreetbets incited such 
movements before? Could this be the start of a stonk revolution?
</p>

<p>
Third, and probably least important, How can we protect wall street and traders alike from incredible stonk volatility? First of all, these big brain hedge funds should be smarter than to invest billions in an infinite risk short of a
popular gaming and internet company. This event exposed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/wall-street-worries-about-regulatory-fallout-from-the-gamestop-saga.html">wall street operates on insider knowledge, safe bets, and market manipulation. </a> From a data science point of view, perhaps this event, and others like it, could be used to train
models that are more adept at identifying such movements better than wallstreet can. A key second point, protecting individual investors has never been the goal of the stonk market. Perhaps some new anti-trust policies could cap hedge fund investments
to less than 100% of a stonk's value. I am not an economist, but being able to bet more than a company is worth against them seems a little suspect. For awhile now, it seems that big firms have been playing around with the market to their own rules,
with cash fees as little more than a cost of doing business. 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps finally, this is the market waking up to broad and malicious manipulation that has been running rampant for decades. Perhaps, this event incentivizes politicians to regulate wall street and develop intelligent and flexible models for detecting
market manipulation. Surely, no matter the outcome, smart data scientists can take advantage of the wealth of information produced on public forums to better understand how to make the stonk market a more ethical and equal place.
