The Office enjoyed a widely celebrated and enjoyed span of 9 seasons, a feat that few television shows ever achieve. The Office sustained incredibly consistent viewership
throughout these 9 years of production, despite a ratings and viewership slump near the end of the series. As it began as a genre defining benchmark for mockumentary TV,
The Office enjoyed success from the get go, sustaining a consistent rating and viewer count for nearly 7 years before its first slump. Likewise, it was one of the best adaptations of 
dramatic and comedic themes, a crossover which inspired a variety of shows to follow, including Modern Family and Parks and Recreation. Finally, it's long lasting success was due to a multitude of factors, 
one of which was the incredibly talented cast and writers room, which in most cases shared personnel. The data for this analysis was sourced @ <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset>kaggle.com</a> and analyzed in Tableau.

The show thrived for years with a relatively tight IMDB rating span of 6.5 to 9.8 , with the vast majority of episodes rating above 8.0, with an average of ~8.2. This places The Office 3rd ranked all time in comedies, and 43rd ranked all time on IMDB's Top TV rankings. <a href=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv> (IMDB Top TV)</a>
This success came because of a quick, witty, and fresh approach to traditional televised comedy, which can be attributed to the original UK version of The Office. What cannot, however, be attributed to the original, is most of the writing and plot decisions. Ricky Gervais had a heavy influence on earlier seasons, but the writers room later prefered
minds such as Mindi Kaling, B.J. Novak, and the revered Steve Carrell and Paul Lieberstein. Given that most of the frequent writers were also actors in the show, they had a tremendous amount of insight into the comedic rhythm and style of the show, which contributed tremendously to the shows success.

This success was in light of a new medium being practiced on set, the single camera
mockumentary. Normally, sit coms use multiple cameras on a live set, but in the early 2000s some shows had experimented with a single camera, cinematic inspired production. Such shows included Arrested Development and the earlier UK iteration of The Office.
This storytelling method opens up creative possibilities that had not been explored before, but presented a number of challenges as well. First of all, the ability to change settings more frequently opened up a number of locations 
and interesting side stories, such as the lake retreat and small tales around the office itself. Using a pseudo-real set allowed for more flexibility than a multi-camera sitcom stage. One of the challenges that presented itself was the lack
of an audience, which for years had helped with comedic timing. Now, live audiences are a relic of a bygone era, mostly thanks to sit coms like The Office. Instead, the writers had to create more creative and hard hitting jokes and irony, using character expressions
and reactions as the main mechanic to convey humor. The success of this technique is evident in the ratings and viewership values, which averaged a remarkable 8.237 over 9 seasons.

One of the largest boons for the show was the frequent blending of comedy and drama. No matter how silly Michael Scott's decisions and manerisms were, the audience couldn't help but feel for him when his life encountered more ebb than flow. Of course, part of this is attributed to Steve's 
phenomenal acting, with the writers room being responsible for the rest. This was not the norm before the late 90s and 2000s. Shows such as Friends had a heavy influence on similar heartfelt comedies of the time, and certainly rubbed off on The Office, but the way The Office was shot made the drama feel
more real and relateable. In a lot of ways, using a single camera mockumentary style erased more barriers between audience and character than a live audience ever could. It allowed the audience to forget, if just for a few minutes, that the show is a scripted, imagined story, and suspend disbelief.
Certainly, Pam and Jim's relationship felt a lot more tangible than Rachael and Ross's short lived escapade. This methodology allowed for a greater range of emotion, with profound highs and lows evidenced by the viewership and ratings over the years.

<p>
The Office proved one of the most successful television formulas of all time, inspiring countless dramas and comedies alike. It has truly left a legacy on mutliple generations of film and television, as well as a profound mark on society.
A lot of it's laughs were created by navigating the narrow boundary between comedy and pathos, creating a world filled with emotion and enticing character development. It left an unprecedented span of quality television accessible for anyone with even the slightest of a sense of humor.
